# An inspection is a conceptual connection between a visit and an individual report.
# In other words, a visit has many reports though some inspection. Conversely,
# a report has many visits through several inspections. The table
# contains information that don't fit within a particular table, namely the
# identification_type (which essentially represents the history of a report status).
